We wrote code to handle the creat, open, read, write, close, unlink, exec, join, and exit sys calls
in them we take the parameters passed and create the functionality outlined in the header file. 
We also wrote code to allocate and translate physical pages into virtual pages dedicated to each process
and from there use them in translating between read and write virtual memory.

It appears to run fairly well, we were running short on time later in the project so the majority
of our testing was largely running provided tests and ensuring that newer sections didn't break
old tests.

Both partners worked together on this project largely pair programing for the majority of it.
